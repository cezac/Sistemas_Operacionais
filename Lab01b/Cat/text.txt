Daddy's flown across the ocean

Leaving just a memory

Snapshot in the family album

Daddy what else did you leave for me?

Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?

All in all it was just a brick in the wall.

All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.



"You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still lady!"



When we grew up and went to school

There were certain teachers who would

Hurt the children in any way they could

(oof!)

By pouring their derision

Upon anything we did

And exposing every weakness

However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known

When they got home at night, their fat and

Psychopathic wives would thrash them

Within inches of their lives.
